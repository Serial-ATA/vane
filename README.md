# About vane

Vane is a plugin-suite which provides many immersive and lore friendly additions to vanilla minecraft.
It will run on any [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) based minecraft server.

[**For a comprehensive feature overview, visit the official website.**](https://oddlama.github.io/vane/)

- <img width="auto" height="20px" src="https://github.com/oddlama/vane/blob/main/docs/assets/minecraft/textures/item/firework_rocket.png"> Lore friendly and properly integrated immersive features.
  Vane augments the classic vanilla experience, and doesn't try to replace it.
  Generally, player's are not supposed to notice which features were introduced by vane.

## Installation

If you are setting up a new server, check out our [Server Installer](https://oddlama.github.io/minecraft-server)
for an easy way to properly setup a minecraft server with vane, autostart, 3D online map, and more awesome features.

Otherwise, simply download all desired jars files from the [Releases](https://github.com/oddlama/vane/releases/latest) and put them into the `plugins/` directory.
Grab the `all-plugins.zip` if you don't want to download each file by hand.
You also need the newest version of [ProtocolLib](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/).

For a comprehensive guide, visit the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/oddlama/vane/wiki/Installation-Guide) on the wiki.

## Proxy Installation (vane-waterfall, vane-velocity)

Download the `vane-{waterfall, velocity}.jar` into the proxy server's `plugins/` directory.
The configuration will be generated on first start.

### Enabling Authentication Multiplexing

#### Waterfall

Before using multiplexers, you must define listeners (distinct ports) for your servers in the
proxy's `config.yml`.

Afterwards, all further configuration is handled in the plugin's `config.toml`

#### Velocity

All configuration is handled in the plugin's `config.toml`

### Permission management

There are permissions players will need to perform certain actions, such as starting offline
servers and joining servers in maintenance mode.

#### Waterfall

Permissions **must** be defined in the proxy's `config.yml`! External permissions plugins
will **not** work.

These permissions must be assigned to the player's **UUID**. *THIS IS IMPORTANT* and
won't work with player names.

#### Velocity

Permissions can be handled by any external permissions plugin, such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net).
Unlike Waterfall, this **will** work with player names or UUIDs.

Check the config for additional settings to manage your servers.

## Building from source

You can of course build the plugin yourself. To do that you need at least JDK 17.

1. Execute `./gradlew build`
2. All resulting jar files that can be used on a server will be in `target/`.

If you experience "peer not authenticated" issues from gradle, just retry.
Seems to be a skittish integration between gradle and maven repositories.
